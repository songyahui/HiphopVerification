# Automated Temporal Verification for HipHop.js

HipHop.js [7] is a synchronous reactive language that adds synchronous concurrency and preemption to JavaScript, inspired from Esterel and built on top of Hop.js. HipHop.js simplifies the program- ming of non-trivial temporal behaviors as found in complex web inter- faces or IoT controllers and the cooperation between synchronous and asynchronous activities. In this paper, we present the first solution to ensure temporal properties for HipHop.js programs via a Hoare-style verifier and a term rewriting system (T.r.s) on synced Effects. The main contribution is the forward verification able to accumulate effects from the source code, check the temporal specifications annotated in precon- dition and postcondition. We represent temporal properties in synced effects, an extended regular language, and soundly and efficiently solve the language inclusions using a back-end T.r.s. We prototype this logic on top of the HIP/SLEEK system and show our methodâ€™s feasibility using a number of case studies.
